This program was created on Windows 10
with python 3.1.0 version + tkinter (GUI)

No other tools or external library has been used on this project.

All project was created inside 3 .py files:

- main.py > the main which contains the main loop of my GUI program. This file create user interface, ask user to open a disk image and after that allow to start defragmentation.

- Disk.py > this file contains a class for my disk image and all his relative attributes and methods.

- Defrag.py > this file contains a list of prints on console to show to the user all general informations about the loaded disk image. It wasn't requested by the project but I had fun to create it and receive a positive output from disk every time I did experiments with it.
